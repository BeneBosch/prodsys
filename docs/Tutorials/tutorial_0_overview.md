# Tutorials overview

This section contains a series of tutorials that will guide you through the process of modelling and simulating a production system using `prodys`. The following tutorials are available:

- [Tutorial 1: Modelling and simulating a production system](tutorial_1_modelling_and_simulating_a_production_system.md)
- [Tutorial 2: Analyzing simulation results](tutorial_2_analyzing_simulation_results.md)
- [Tutorial 3: Optimizing a production system](tutorial_3_optimizing_a_production_system.md)
- [Tutorial 4: Optimizing production control](tutorial_4_optimizing_production_control.md)

All of the tutorials are also on the [github page of prodsys](https://github.com/sdm4fzi/prodsys) in the examples folder as jupyter notebooks available, so that you can run them yourself.

In the future, more tutorials will be added to this section. If you have any suggestions for new tutorials, please create an issue on [prodsys' github page](https://github.com/sdm4fzi/prodsys).
