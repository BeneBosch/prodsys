    "Additionally, we can change the routing policy in the production system. A routing policy is not used for heuristically solving a sequencing problem as the control policy but for solving the routing problem for parallel redundant resources. In our example, bot milling machine and work center provide the milling process. While simulating, we need to have some logic how to decide which product is processed on which resource. By default, the routing policy is `random`, which means that the routing is randomly chosen. However, we can also change the routing policy to `shortest_queue`, which means that the product is always routed to the resource with the shortest queue:"

    "So far, we only studied the express API of `prodsys`. However, `prodsys` also provides a more detailed API that allows to model more complex production systems with `prodsys.models`. The models API uses ID references for connecting the different entities (processes, products, resources etc.) that results in a flat data structure instead of nested hierarchical relationsship, as the express API. Whilst the hierarchical structure is easy for programmatically creating production systems, the flat data structure is more convenient for serializing the data, i.e. saving and loading production systems. All algorithms in `prodsys` use the models API. For luck, all express API objects can be converted to models API objects and vice versa."
